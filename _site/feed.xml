<p>The journey starts here
Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman’s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there’s no turning back from science.

<p>Here’s we’re going to solve: <strong><em>which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?</em></strong></p>

<p>A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs">(here’s some info for the curious)</a>. Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.</p>

<p><strong>3. Modeling</strong></p>

<p>We will create a function that will calculate a ratio of house prices, comparing the price of a house in 2018 to the price in 1998.</p>

<p>This function will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take a filter of dataframe, specifically where this filter constrains the London_Borough, as an argument. For example, one admissible argument should be: dataframe[dataframe[‘London_Borough’]==’Camden’].</li>
  <li>Get the Average Price for that Borough, for the years 1998 and 2018.</li>
  <li>Calculate the ratio of the Average Price for 1998 divided by the Average Price for 2018.</li>
  <li>Return that ratio.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you’ve written this function, you ultimately want to use it to iterate through all the unique London_Boroughs and work out the ratio capturing the difference of house prices between 1998 and 2018.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
