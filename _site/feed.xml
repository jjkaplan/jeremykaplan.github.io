<p>The journey starts here
Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman’s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there’s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jamal Kaplan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This will be another post]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">London Boroghs` House Price.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/06/07/London-Boroghs-House-Price.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="London Boroghs` House Price." /><published>2022-06-07T07:45:13-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-07T07:45:13-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/06/07/London%20Boroghs%60%20House%20Price</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/06/07/London-Boroghs-House-Price.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="data-exploration-capstone-project">Data Exploration Capstone Project</h1>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<p>Here’s we’re going to solve: <strong><em>which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?</em></strong></p>

<p>A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs">(here’s some info for the curious)</a>. Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.</p>

<h4 id="12--loading-the-data">1.2.  Loading the data</h4>
<p>Your data comes from the <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/">London Datastore</a>: a free, open-source data-sharing portal for London-oriented datasets.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># First, make a variable called url_LondonHousePrices, and assign it the following link, enclosed in quotation-marks as a string:

<h3 id="2-cleaning-transforming-and-visualizing">2. Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing</h3>
<p>This second stage is arguably the most important part of any Data Science project. The first thing to do is take a proper look at the data. Cleaning forms the majority of this stage, and can be done both before or after Transformation.</p>

<p>The end goal of data cleaning is to have tidy data. When data is tidy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each variable has a column.</li>
  <li>Each observation forms a row.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep the end goal in mind as you move through this process, every step will take you closer.</p>

<p><strong>2.1. Exploring your data</strong></p>

<p>Think about your pandas functions for checking out a dataframe.</p>

<p><strong>3. Modeling</strong></p>

<p>Consider creating a function that will calculate a ratio of house prices, comparing the price of a house in 2018 to the price in 1998.</p>

<p>Consider calling this function create_price_ratio.</p>

<p>You’d want this function to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take a filter of dfg, specifically where this filter constrains the London_Borough, as an argument. For example, one admissible argument should be: dfg[dfg[‘London_Borough’]==’Camden’].</li>
  <li>Get the Average Price for that Borough, for the years 1998 and 2018.</li>
  <li>Calculate the ratio of the Average Price for 1998 divided by the Average Price for 2018.</li>
  <li>Return that ratio.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you’ve written this function, you ultimately want to use it to iterate through all the unique London_Boroughs and work out the ratio capturing the difference of house prices between 1998 and 2018.</p>

<p>Bear in mind: you don’t have to write a function like this if you don’t want to. If you can solve the brief otherwise, then great!</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.
